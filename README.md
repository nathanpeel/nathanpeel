### Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nathan

I am a full-stack software engineer passionate about contributing to determined teams that help people and solve problems. I specialize in React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I strive to create maintainable and user-friendly applications with genuine fervor and dedication.

Currently, I am contributing to an open-source tool called Next.Nav, which is a VS Code Extension for navigating and modifying routes in Next.js applications. 

Outside of software engineering, I spend my time reading philosophical books, playing violin, visiting the San Diego Zoo and Birch Aquarium, and reading  Seinen Manga such as Berserk or Monster.
